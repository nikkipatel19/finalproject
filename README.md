# BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding

Link to Research paper - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf

In this project our aim is to Assess the efficiency of the approach outlined in the paper "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" through the examination of accuracy as a metric of performance.


# Goals
* Applying different Machine Learning algorithms for prediction and finding most accurate model.
* Based on the sentences given in the input, identify its category.

These goals present a unique real-world Machine Learning prediction problem and involve solving various Machine Learning tasks: data wrangling, feature extraction and outcome prediction.

# Datasets
We have used two datasets 
Finance_Data.csv - https://github.com/nikkipatel19/finalproject/blob/main/Finance_Data.csv
IMDB_dataset.csv - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

# Model
We are trying with different algorithms like BERT, random forest classifier, XGBoost, LinearSVC. After trying with all these approaches ,we will be comparing the accuracy of all of them and use the best model for prediction.

# Implementation 

We tried multiple classifiers and  After trying with all that ,we have compared the accuracy of all of them and analysed the result in orded to conclude BERT works well as compare to others.

we tested the methodology of the selected research paper on new datasets to evaluate its effectiveness in different contexts.

After installing all the necessary libraries, mentioned above, run https://github.com/nikkipatel19/finalproject/blob/main/IMDB_Movie_Review.ipynb For getting the same output as research paper code.
